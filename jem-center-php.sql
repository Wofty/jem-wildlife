These projects aim to preserve and restore the tiger’s habitat, reduce human-tiger conflict, enhance anti-poaching measures, and increase public awareness and support for tiger conservation.', 'The main threats to the Bengal tiger are poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Poaching is driven by the illegal trade in tiger parts, which are used for traditional medicine, ornaments, and trophies. Habitat loss is caused by deforestation, agriculture, infrastructure development, and human settlement. Habitat fragmentation isolates tiger populations and reduces their genetic diversity and viability. Other threats include human-wildlife conflict, prey depletion, disease, and climate change.', '2009-09-16', ' The Bengal tiger is an important symbol of culture, religion, and national identity in many parts of Asia.

It has a varied diet, consisting of over 400 types of food, including fruits, leaves, seeds, eggs, honey, insects, and soil. It travels on the ground more than its Sumatran counterpart, as it faces no large terrestrial predators in Borneo.', '35–45 years in the wild; up to 60 years in captivity.', 'Several organizations are working to protect the Bornean orangutan and its habitat, such as the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, the Orangutan Foundation International, and the World Wildlife Fund. They conduct research, rescue and rehabilitate orangutans, support local communities, and promote sustainable practices. Some of the conservation projects include the establishment of protected areas, the restoration of degraded forests, the prevention of illegal logging and poaching, the education and awareness campaigns, and the promotion of ecotourism.', 'The main threats to the Bornean orangutan are habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation due to the expansion of palm oil plantations, logging, mining, agriculture, and infrastructure development. It also faces the risk of hunting, capture, and trade for meat, pets, or traditional medicine. Other threats include diseases, fires, droughts, and climate change.', '2016-05-18', 'The Bornean orangutan is an important indicator of the health and biodiversity of the tropical rain forest ecosystem, as it plays a role in seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and forest regeneration. It is also a flagship species for conservation, as it attracts public attention and support for its protection.

They also face competition from other primates, such as macaques and gibbons, for food and space.', '2011-03-10', 'The Sumatran orangutan is an important species for conservation, as it is a flagship species, a keystone species, and an umbrella species. It is a flagship species, meaning it is a charismatic and popular animal that can raise awareness and support for conservation efforts. It is a keystone species, meaning it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance and diversity of its habitat. It is an umbrella species, meaning its conservation can benefit many other species that share its habitat. The Sumatran orangutan is also a close relative of humans, sharing 97% of our DNA, and can teach us about our evolutionary history and our cognitive and social abilities.', 'sumatran_orangutan.jpg'),

It has a black back and a white belly, with a stripe looping from the eyes to the chin. It has a black beak that fades into pink on the bottom. It molts twice a year, before breeding.', 'It is a monogamous species, mating for life and breeding year-round, depending on food availability and sea temperature. It lays one or two eggs in caves and crevices, and incubates them for 38–40 days. Both parents share the duties of incubation and feeding the chicks. It takes 60–65 days for the chicks to become independent. It feeds on small schooling fish and crustaceans, and stays near the breeding area throughout the year. It cools off by going in the water, stretching out its flippers, or panting.', '15 to 20 years in the wild, but often reduced by predation and environmental factors.', 'The Galápagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation monitor and protect the penguin population and its habitat. They also conduct research and education programs to raise awareness and support for the species. Some conservation measures include controlling introduced predators, restoring native vegetation, and reducing human disturbance and pollution.', 'The main threats to the Galápagos penguin are climate change, especially the El Niño phenomenon, which reduces food availability and causes nest failure; predation by sharks, whales, seals, hawks, owls, and introduced species such as cats, dogs, and rats; disease and parasites; oil spills and plastic pollution; and illegal fishing and poaching.', '0000-00-00', 'The Galápagos penguin is a unique and fascinating species that can teach us about adaptation, evolution, and conservation. It is one of the few penguin species that live in a tropical environment, thanks to the cool currents that bring nutrients to the islands. It is also one of the rarest penguin species, with only about 1,200 mature individuals left in the wild. It faces many challenges and threats, but also benefits from the protection and support of local and international organizations. It is an emblematic species of the Galápagos Islands, a World Heritage Site and a natural laboratory for scientific discovery.', 'galapagos_penguin_1.jpg'),

Their slow-moving, curious nature has led to violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships. Some manatees have been found with over 50 scars on them from propeller blades.
